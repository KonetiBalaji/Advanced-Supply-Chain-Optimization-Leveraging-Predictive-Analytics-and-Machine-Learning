### **Next Steps:**
1. **Set up the file structure** based on the outline provided.
2. **Start with data exploration**:
   - Open the `src/data_exploration.py` file to load and inspect the data.
   - Perform initial data cleaning and generate basic visualizations and summary statistics.
3. **Proceed with data preprocessing** once the exploration is done, using the `src/data_preprocessing.py` script.

You can now push this structure and **README.md** to your GitHub repo and keep updating it as you progress with each phase.

Let me know when you're ready to start, or if you need help with the initial data exploration code!
