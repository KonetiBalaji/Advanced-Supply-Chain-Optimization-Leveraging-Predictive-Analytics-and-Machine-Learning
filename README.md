# Supply Chain Optimization: Leveraging Predictive Analytics and Machine Learning with DataCo SMART Dataset

## Project Overview

This project aims to optimize supply chain operations using predictive analytics and machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to forecast demand, improve inventory management, and minimize logistics costs. The project uses the **DataCo SMART Supply Chain Dataset**, which contains historical data on product demand, inventory levels, transportation costs, and other supply chain metrics.

### Key Objectives:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understand the dataset structure, clean the data, and analyze trends.
2. **Demand Forecasting**: Build models to predict future demand using time series analysis and machine learning techniques.
3. **Supply Chain Optimization**: Use optimization techniques to minimize costs and improve efficiency across the supply chain.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Load and explore the raw data files.
   - Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
   - Generate summary statistics and visualizations for an initial understanding of the data.

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data for machine learning models.
   - Perform feature engineering and encode categorical variables.
   - Scale numerical features and handle imbalances.

### 3. **Demand Forecasting**:
   - Build and evaluate demand forecasting models using:
     - **ARIMA** (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
     - **Prophet** (by Facebook)
     - **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory for time series)

### 4. **Supply Chain Optimization**:
   - Apply **Linear Programming (LP)** or **Integer Linear Programming (ILP)** to minimize transportation, inventory, and production costs.
   - Use **PuLP**, **SciPy**, or **Google OR-Tools** for optimization modeling.

### 5. **Model Evaluation and Results**:
   - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, RMSE for forecasting).
   - Visualize results and present findings in the form of graphs, charts, and reports.
